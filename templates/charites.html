					<p class="leadin">The American Minute-man Organization understands that the greatest sacrifice someone can make is one for his country. It is the greatest most selfless sacrifice of all, stepping up to fight and possibly die for the freedoms our founding fathers gave us. These freedoms are not free, they must be fought for everyday, every second, minute of every hour 365 days a year.</p>
					<p>This selfless sacrifice most time goes unnoticed by many, taking a toll on our warriors the toll that it takes on our warriors is everlasting. and making the transition to a civilian difficult. Their struggles are unspeakable and something most Americans take for granted.It makes the transition back to the life of a civilian difficult for many. The struggle to leave it behind, or the memories burned into their mind is something unspeakable. </p>

						<li class="margin-btm-25"> Times we as mindless civilians take for granted, is a day, time a mark in their life of a experience we Americans haven't had to endure because of their sacrifice.</li>
						<li class="margin-btm-25"> The AMMO Foundation and members understand this as some are veterans themselves. One of our organization's most important charities will be raising money to house homeless veterans. We will be actively working with businesses to raise the appropriate funds to build homes for veterans out of shipping containers.</li>
						<li class="margin-btm-25"> This will be a place to call their own. We then will assist them with the transition back in to civilian life.</li>
						<li class="margin-btm-25"> Building them a modern home, finding a job, setting them on a road to recovery, most importantly off of the streets.</li>
						<li class="margin-btm-25"> AMMO will actively seek out counseling for any thing they maybe struggling with, and then use our vast network of business' to provide employment.</li>
						<li class="margin-btm-25"> As well as train those in trades that will rebuild their self-worth, setting them back on a path to recovery.</li>
						<li class="margin-btm-25"> AMMO will also be providing work shops once a month with veterans to assist them on creating their own business. Becoming a an entrepreneur is the greatest freedom any American could have.</li>
