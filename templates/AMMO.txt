1.  American Exceptionalism of a Republic, by respect for American traditions, support of Christian values, Greco-Roman Law, moral absolutism, economic wealth, anti-communism, advocacy of American Exceptionalism, and a defense of Western culture from threats posed by "creeping socialism", moral relativism, multiculturalism and liberal internationalism.

2.  Liberty is a core value, with a particular emphasis on strengthening the free market, limiting the size and scope of government in the economy, and opposition to high taxes and government or labor union encroachment on the entrepreneur.


3.  AMMO supports equality of opportunity for all. The successes or failure fall primarily on the person or companies shoulders, effort and hard-work drives success.

4.  American Exceptionalism considers individual liberty, within the bounds of conformity to American values, as the fundamental trait of a Republic, which contrasts with modern American liberals, who generally place a greater value on equality, regulation and social justice by a form of
"Total Government".
